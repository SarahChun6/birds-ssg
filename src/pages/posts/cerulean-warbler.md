## About Cerulean Warbler
Each spring this small blue forest bird travels from the northern Andes mountains to the eastern United States to breed. More of a treetop bird than most warblers, the Cerulean usually stays high in tall deciduous trees on the breeding grounds, where it is most easily detected by the male’s buzzy song. The male has the iconic cerulean plumage with white breast feathers, while the female has distinctly yellow undertone to her blue plumage and white lines over each of her eyes. An insectivore, it preys on insects it finds on leaves, occasionally eating fatty plant bits to supplement its diet when it needs extra energy during migration.

## Extinction Threat
By 2080, this already declining Neotropical migrant is projected to have 98 percent of its current summer range shifted away from the current core, but it has potential to expand in the north, according to Audubon’s climate model. Mature hardwood forests that the bird depends on may not exist to the north and the forests expansion may not keep pace with the changing climate.

## Cool Facts
- Often hops around the forest, going from vine to vine to maneuver through the tree canopy.
- Both the male and female can be very aggressive in defending the nesting territory, even physically attacking other Cerulean Warblers that invade the territory.
- Though monogamous, this warbler will not necessarily mate with the same bird every breeding season.
- The female collects spider and caterpillar silk to build her nest.
